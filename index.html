            <h2>Fluent Design For Web</h2>
            <p>Think for a moment that, what would happen if you combine the Metro UI, with 
                Material Design, the result is Fluent Design also called Fabric UI.
            </p>
            <p>Fluent Design is the design which is used by Windows 10 and other UWP apps. But why should 
                it be limited to UWP apps only, why can't we use the same for websites. That's why, we have 
                come up with this project, where we aim to recreate the Fluent Design for web.
